## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

During this challenge, I was forced to look for ways to center the map. It needed to be in the middle of the page, so I opted for Flexbox.

To find my way around, I found a FlexBox cheatsheet: [Flex-CheatSheet](https://yoksel.github.io/flex-cheatsheet/)

### Continued development

Some concepts, for me, deserve to be deepened because I absolutely do not master them:
   - Flexbox
   - Grid

**Note: Delete this note and replace the list above with resources that helped you during the challenge. These could come in handy for anyone viewing your solution or for yourself when you look back on this project in the future.**
